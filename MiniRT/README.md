# MiniRT

## Description

The **main goal** of miniRT is to prove to ourselves that **we can implement any mathematical or physical formulas without being a mathematician**.  

Additionally, ***we will generate an image*** containing simple trigonometrical objects (spheres, cylinders, planes) with **ray-tracing** technique.  

Moreover, we will be able to ***show off*** nice-looking pictures to ***justify*** the number of hours we are spending at school.

## Instructions

1. Download minilibx-linux and bring it to this directory
2. Stay in the same directory
3. Type `make`
4. Type `./miniRT <path to the *.rt file>`
5. Open your mouth and enjoy the scene .-.

__AI usage:__ 
* generate test-cases for
	* testing functions (is_double, ft_strtod, ...)
	* testing scenes
* get color definitions in header (GREEN, BLUE, ...)
* discover weaknesses of functions

## Additional info
Our code is working with **at least 1 camera provided**  
We also implemented multiple light sources and specular reflection  
You can also add resolution in .rt file `(R 1920 1080)`

[//]: # (Add ./images directory with images and place in markdown file later)
